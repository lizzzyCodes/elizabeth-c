      Iâ€™m a software engineer and a advocate for diversity in tech.
      <br />  I have over a year of full-time software engineering experience. my background is in data science and I love front end development. I was born and raised in Des Moines, Washington. (40 min from Seattle) and I am based in Chicago.
      <br /> Outside work, I spend most of my time mentoring students in various aspects of their student journey, including mock interviews for selective programs, college applications and reinforcing computer science topics.
      <br /> As the first in my family to graduate from college and attending a school with capacity-constrained majors (academic programs that have limited enrollment capacity) my university journey began with the disheartening advice from advisors who discouraged me from applying to computer science.
      <br /> My personal journey has inspired a deep commitment to helping and uplifting the community that faces similar struggles. By sharing my story and offering support, I aim to empower others to navigate the challenges of being a first-generation college student like myself fostering a sense of belonging and resilience within the community.

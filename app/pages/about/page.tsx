          Iâ€™m a software engineer and a advocate for diversity in tech.
          <br /> I have over 2 years of full-time software engineering
          experience, with a background in Data Science, and a passion for front
          end development. I was born and raised in Des Moines, Washington. (40
          min from Seattle).
          <br /> Outside work, I spend most of my time mentoring students on
          various aspects of their academic journeys, including mock interviews
          for selective programs, college applications and reinforcing computer
          science topics.
          <br /> As the first in my family to graduate from college and having
          attended a school with capacity-constrained majors my university
          journey began with the disheartening advice from advisors who
          discouraged me from applying to computer science.
          <br /> My personal journey has inspired a deep commitment to helping
          and uplifting the community that finds itself in similar situations.
          By sharing my story and offering support, I aim to empower others to
          navigate the challenges of being a first-generation college student
          like myself.
